# Python Utils

This repository contains various tool functions written in Python.

Rather than write code and let it be swept away by lack of use, putting them online like this will make it possible for me (and others, who knows) to reuse this work.

* `lucas.py` : Web scraping functions.
* `frog.py` : Functional programming in Python (somewhat).
* `jsonl.py` : A set of functions to easily export pandas DataFrames and Series to JSONL format.
